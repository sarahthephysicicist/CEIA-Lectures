This is the resource repository for my annual CEIA Leaving Cert Maths Lectures. There are three lectures: Map of Mathematics, Algebra 2 and Complex Numbers.
For each lecture, I have included my powerpoint slides, and an additional resource document where I go through worked examples and provide additional resources and reading materials.
Good luck with your Leaving Cert!!
